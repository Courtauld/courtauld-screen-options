# courtauld-screen-options

This WordPress plugin sets the default 'Screen options' for all new users.

When any new user is registered this plugin runs and sets their default viewing options.

This way we don't have to worry about Screen Options and dragging and dropping widgets around.

This is designed to help new users ease into using WordPress, and to avoid having to get them to individually set their own preferences.

This works independently of the installed theme.
